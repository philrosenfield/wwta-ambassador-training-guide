## WWT Crash Course
(There is more detailed info about some of these topics in the handout titled “WWT Classroom Pointers.”)
   * Overview of what WWT is.
   * Tour of WWT Tour to quickly orient everyone, show some highlights of the different views.
   * Anatomy of screen
       * Top menu, tabs, triangle-secondary menus
       * Context bar
       * Field of view
   * More on each View:
     * Solar System
     * **Misconception alert:**  Actual vs Large planet sizes.
       * “Actual” represents the correct scale in our solar system.  “Large” makes things easier to see and understand, but make sure students recognize that the Sun doesn’t really take up such a significant fraction of Mercury’s orbit, among other things.
       * (Must use “actual” with “minor orbits” displayed).
     * Stepping forward in time.
     * Demonstrating night/day; demonstrating moon phases.
     * Beyond Solar System:
       * **Misconception alert:** Constellations are not “flat.”
          * Navigate to Orion
          * Right click on left-most star in belt, “Alnitak” -> “Show Object”
          * Zoom out just enough to “reconstruct” Orion as it appears to us.  Now pan around to show what Orion would look like from the perspective of other parts of our galaxy.
       * Keep zooming out to Milky Way - best map of our galaxy that has been made by astronomers.
          * Field of View indicator points out how far away we are viewing an object from.  To comfortably “see” the whole Milky Way, you have to be about 200k-250k lt yrs outside.  Point out that if we could travel at the speed of light to see that view of the MW, take a picture, and send it back, it would take half a million years.
       * Keep zooming out to see other galaxies.
          * Point out that each dot is an entire galaxy, with hundreds of billions of stars in it.
          * **Misconception alert:** The Universe is NOT shaped like a bow-tie.
            * If you orient the galaxy 3D map so it does look like a bow tie, and then zoom back in toward Milky Way, you can show that the plane of the galaxy lines up with the missing part of the map.  Astronomers intentionally chose NOT to map that part of the universe because it’s hard to see through all the gas and dust in our own galaxy and get accurate measurements.
     * Sky View:
       * Not just pretty pictures.  (cf. APOD - beautiful, but out of context images from space).
         * In WWT, view images in their correct locations in the sky, sized correctly relative to the things around them.  Example - famous Orion Nebula image from HST shows new stars forming in proplyds.  That photo is a tiny fraction of the entire nebula, which is only a small part of this very well-known constellation.
         * Want to know more about an image?  Right-click on the image in the display, or on its thumbnail, to bring up the “Finder Scope.”  If it’s from a NASA observatory, most of the time, the hyperlink under “Image Credits” will take you to a website with a press release and more info about what’s in the image and what’s significant about it.
         * If it’s a reasonably well-known object, you can also click “Research” -> “Information” -> “Look up on Wikipedia” to learn more about it.
           * Check with the teachers to find out what they teach kids about Wikipedia.  Some ban it, but research has shown that Wikipedia is no less accurate than Britannica, etc.  The astronomy articles often are over the heads of middle schoolers but tend to be accurate.
       * **Misconception alert:** “It looks like there’s a UFO in that part of the sky.”
         * The default imagery in “Sky” view is the Digitized Sky Survey, created by scanning old photographic plates.  These plates have common artifacts that seem to really fascinate kids.
           * The “UFO” like images appear near bright stars (like Sirius) and are created by internal reflection in the telescope optics.
           * Lines or streaks often appear from passing airplanes or satellites.
       * You can crossfade between wavelengths to show benefits of viewing the same object at different parts of the EM spectrum.  (This may be beyond middle school level).
           * Click “Explore” tab -> “All Sky Surveys”
           * Choose one survey, say “WISE All Sky.” (infrared).  Right click on thumbnail -> “Set as foreground imagery”
           * Choose another, say, “Digitized Sky Survey,” (visible light).  Right click on thumbnail -> “Set as background imagery”
           * Navigate to some interesting feature, like the center of the Milky Way.
           * Move the “Image Crossfade” slider to show how dusty regions are dark in visible light, but they emit in infrared light.
       * Panoramas
           * **Misconception alert:**  in the “Many Rovers” image, the Rover appears many times because it’s a panorama made up of many individual photos stitched together.  There was only 1 Rover at that location, photographed many times.
           * Any panorama labeled “Stereo” can be viewed with red-blue 3D glasses.   Kids love them.  My personal favorite is “Spirit: West Valley (stereo)” - there’s a very well defined cliff that looks terrific with the glasses.
       * Earth views
           * Imagery -> “Earth at Night” is very interesting for pointing out population density around the world.
           * Imagery -> “Virtual Earth Hybrid” overlays a map on the Earth terrain.  Kids love looking for their own house or school.
     * Planet views
        * Mars has some really cool features to point out.
           * Olympus Mons is a volcano that is 3 times higher than Mt. Everest (and Mars smaller than Earth!)
           * Valles Marineris is a “grand canyon” that would span across the whole US.
              * You can tilt Mars and orient it, so it looks like you’re driving right along the canyon.
        * If you have 3D glasses, you can turn on a “Stereo” view of the planets and Earth. Click on the small triangle at the bottom of the “View” tab to bring up the 2ndary menu -> “Stereo” ->”Anaglyph Red-Cyan.”  (Be sure to turn this off by unchecking it when you’re done, else it will mess up other views).
   * WWT Tours
     * Narrated, scripted paths through the sky.  NOT meant to be viewed as “movies.”  If you see something interesting, you can pause, use the finder scope to learn more about it.
     * Tours that are especially good for middle school audiences
       * Ring Nebula (by 6-yo Benjamin)
       * Moon Phases Tutorial
       * Tour of WWT Tour - to get them acclimated
       * Galileo’s New Order - for upper middle school, or high school.
       * Astronomy for Everyone

     * How to make a 3-slide tour
       * Open “Create New Tour”
       * Show Tour authoring interface
       * Search for favorite object
       * Add New Slide
       * Zoom in or out or pan - Set end slide position
         * Emphasize difference btw SHOW start/end slide positions vs SET start/end slide position
         * Show how to use yellow triangles at top to go to start/end slide position
     * Adjust slide time
     * Add two more slides
       * Key difference btw using curated WWT imagery vs overlaying your own images (opposites.  do one of each)
          * Using WWT imagery - setup imagery first, then create slide.
              * set up all aspects of slide (view, foreground/background, WWT image) before creating slide.  Once it’s set, you can’t change it without deleting and redoing slide.
          * Adding your own (non-sky) images - create slide first, then overlay imagery.
              * Can change color/opacity of overlaid images.  (Transparent overlays in Galileo tour)
          * (Adding your own sky images is more involved - see https://wwtambassadors.org/wwt/tour-creation for more info.)

     * Add Text
        * label objects of interest

     * Add shapes
        * highlight objects of interest

     * Add sound & music
        * Music must be public domain to publish tour.

        * Animating images, text, shapes
          * Exemplars:
            * Huchra tour
              * Animated arrow/stickman figure.
            * Extrasolar planets tour

     * Other pointers:
       * Label slides so you can keep track
       * Capture new thumbnails
       * Preview Tour from Here.

     * Have a feel for the mechanics of tour-making.  Think about the “art” of story telling.
       * Don’t just show pretty pictures.
       * Don’t just tell that something is true.  Demonstrate how and why.
