## WWT in the Classroom
   * Possible levels of engagement - need to find out what teachers want.
      * 1-day enrichment.
        * Ambassador schedules a day to visit class, gives a short presentation using WWT, engages students in an astronomy-related activity.
      * Curricular engagement
        * Students can explore WWT through a “Scavenger Hunt” that teachers them to navigate around WWT and encourages them to explore different views of the sky.
      * At the request of a teacher, we can prepare tours and resources to reinforce concepts that the teacher is already working with students on.  Moon Phases is an example of this kind of tour.
    * Extracurricular supplement
      * If teachers are already doing astronomy projects with students, they might consider incorporating WWT tours as a final “presentation.”

   ### Ambassador Responsibilities
     * Share your love and enthusiasm for astronomy.  Help to get the kids excited about science.  Show them the value of asking “how?” and “why?” and trying to find sensible answers.
     * Serve as WWT and astronomy “experts”.
     * If you don’t know the answer, model ways to get more information.  Teach students about vetting online resources.
     * Try to steer kids away from common misconceptions.
     * Give us feedback and keep track of ideas to pass on to future Ambassadors.

## Troubleshooting WWT in the Classroom
   * If the sky/universe starts spinning out of control:
      * Click on any of the image thumbnails in the bottom context bar to reset location.
   * If overlaid images are blinking, type “b”.
   * If the program is in a really unusual state:
      * Restore defaults
        * Click the ▼ under the “Settings” tab -> “Restore Defaults”
        * If that doesn’t help, close down WWT and restart it.
   * Please let Pat Udomprasert (pudompra@cfa.harvard.edu) know if students are encountering unusual problems.  The WWT team can’t fix bugs if they don’t know about them.
